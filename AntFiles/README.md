Here are some initial files to get you started with the Ant build file.

You can download them on the virtual machine from the repository. Then, open a Terminal, navigate to the folder and execute the command
ant

The current build.xml file manages to build and run the services (they can be viewed from a browser). For some reason, the built afterwards hangs.

Left:
* ws import
* the client build and run.
